## Acknowledgement:

`The authors acknowledge support by the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg through bwVisu.`

In addition, we kindly ask you to notify us of any reports, conference papers, journal articles, theses, posters, talks which contain results obtained with the help of bwVisu resources by sending an email to bwvisu-support@urz.uni-heidelberg.de stating (e.g. in BibTeX-format):
* author(s)
* title or booktitle
* journal, volume, pages or editors, address, publisher

Such recognition is important for acquiring funding for the next generation hardware, support services, and infrastructure.
