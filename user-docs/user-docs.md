## Accessing data in bwVisu
Once a connection is established to one of the storage backends as described in [getting started](getting-started.md), users can access their data using the directories for the bwForCluster MLS&WISO and SDS@hd in their home directories.

## Known issues

* The terminal inside your job window does not entirely respect German keyboard layout
* Connection to remote data storage like SDS@hd is possible with sshfs only for time being
* The GPU type in the job submission form is ignored at the moment
* Occasionally your web frontend session might freeze after reopening the browser. A manual logout will fix this problem.
